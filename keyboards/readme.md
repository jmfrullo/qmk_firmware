# 60Split-Keymouse Keyboard
This keyboard features a 60% split keyboard with a trackball mouse added to the right side.

MSYS2 command to build board:
* verbose: `qmk compile -kb kb -km default`
* simplified when qmk config is set: `qmk compile`

Note: All other keyboards were removed from this project to remove clutter
